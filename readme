An effort to reduce the clutter in various context menus in Visual Studio.

HOW TO USE
========================================================
Backup your existing settings first!!

1. Download the .vssettings file
2. Go to Visual Studio -> Tools -> Import and Export Settings... -> Import Selected environment settings
3. Follow the wizard to complete the import.

No need to restart IDE. Changes will be effective immediately.


NOTES
========================================================

These customizations were done for Visual C# environment. While this should not affect anything (as they settings are language agnostic), if you run into any issues, do let me know.
